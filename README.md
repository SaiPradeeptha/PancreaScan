Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, with a high mortality rate due to its late-stage diagnosis and aggressive progression. It is often referred to as a “silent killer” because symptoms typically do not appear until the disease has significantly advanced, limiting treatment options and reducing survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as imaging scans and biopsies, can be time-consuming, invasive, and prone to human error. Early detection is crucial to improving patient outcomes, yet it remains a significant challenge in clinical practice. This project intends to solve this discrepancy by creating an effective artificial intelligence-driven deep learning-based pancreatic cancer detection system. Leveraging a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN), the system analyzes medical images to identify potential indicators of pancreatic cancer with high accuracy. Through sophisticated feature extraction techniques, the model classifies images as indicative or non-indicative of cancer, assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions. To ensure accessibility and ease of use, a user-friendly web application has been designed, allowing clinicians to upload medical images for real-time analysis. The system preprocesses the images to maintain consistency and quality before utilizing the trained CNN model for predictions. Beyond detection, the model evaluates the severity of the condition, offering insights into the criticalness of the diagnosis. This feature helps to prioritize patient care, ensuring that individuals with urgent conditions receive timely attention. This project seeks to improve early detection rates, reduce diagnostic delays, and support timely medical interventions. It highlights the transformative potential of computational tools in addressing complex healthcare challenges and improving patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer diagnosis
